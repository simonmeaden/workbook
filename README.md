A simple spreadsheet based on QTableView which allows embedded spreadsheet capability for your applications.

The spreadsheet consists of several public files,

* QWorkbookView which consists of a tabbed multi sheet spreadsheet.
* QWorksheetView which is a single page spreadsheet.
* A set of toolbars similar to those available in Openoffice/Libreoffice/Excel.
* Files can be saved in XLSX format and ODF format.

Notes:
ODF capability is based on the the QOds library https://github.com/f35f22fan/QOds
XLSX capability is based on the QtXlsxWriter library on https://github.com/dbzhang800/QtXlsxWriter

A plugin based function capability is underway but at present it doesn't work so don't use it.
